Employee Dashboard Report

1. Background and Problems

Background:

Organizations rely on effective workforce management to ensure operational success. However, gaining insights into employee data, such as diversity, salary distribution, retention trends, and departmental performance, can be challenging without a consolidated system.

Problems:

Fragmented Data: Employee data was scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult to derive meaningful insights.

Lack of Visibility: There was limited visibility into critical metrics like gender diversity, employee distribution by department, and retention trends.

Decision-Making Delays: Leadership faced delays in making informed decisions due to the absence of a comprehensive dashboard.

2. Solution

To address these challenges, a dynamic and interactive Employee Dashboard was developed using Looker Studio. This dashboard consolidates employee data into a single platform, enabling stakeholders to monitor workforce metrics in real time and make data-driven decisions efficiently.

Centralize and visualize employee data for easier access and decision-making.

Track workforce metrics such as total employees, gender diversity, exit rate, and salary distribution.

Enable dynamic exploration of department-wise data and geospatial mapping of employee locations.

Highlight key insights such as top-paid employees to inform strategic planning.

4. Project Scope

The scope of the project includes:

Aggregating and visualizing employee data from various sources.

Highlighting key metrics such as total employees, median salary, exit rate, and gender diversity.

Visualizing departmental distribution and employee locations.

Providing insights into top-paid employees for strategic planning.

Ensuring the dashboard is interactive, user-friendly, and scalable for future enhancements.
